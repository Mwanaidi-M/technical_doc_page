            <p>
                These offer a way to access elements <em>without</em> referring to their classes. There are 3 selectors
                 that do this:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><span>&gt;</span> - the child combinator.</li>
                <li><span>+ </span>- the adjacent sibling combinator.</li>
                <li><span>~</span> - the general sibling combinator.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                An example is if given a main parent element with divs inside and those divs having inner div as well,
                if we wanted to select all the child and grand-child divs inside of main, we could write:
            </p>
            <pre>
                <code>
                    main div {
                    /* styling CSS */
                  }
                </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                If we wanted to be more specific and select only the child or grand-child divs, the child combinator <strong>></strong>
                comes in handy. Unlike the descendant combinator, it will only select direct children.The child selector 
                will select an element that is one level of indentation down.
            </p>
            <pre>
            <code>
            /* This rule will only select divs with a 
            class of child */
            main > div {
            /* Our cool CSS */
            }
            /* This rule will only select divs with 
            a class of grand-child */
            main > div > div {
            /* More cool CSS */
            }
            </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                In order to select an element that is adjacent to our target, or on the same level of 
                indentation, we can use the adjacent sibling combinator <strong>+</strong>.
            </p>
            <pre>
            <code>
            /* This rule will only select the div 
            with the class child group2 */
            .group1 + div {
            /* Our cool CSS */
            }

            /* This rule will only select the div
            with the class child group3 */
            .group1 + div + div {
            /* More cool CSS */
            }
            </code>
            </pre>
            <p>
                If we want to select all of an element's siblings and not just the first one, we can use 
                the general sibling combinator <strong>~</strong>.
            </p>
            <pre>
            <code>
            /* This rule will select all of .group1's 
            siblings - in this case the 2nd and 3rd .child divs*/
            .group1 ~ div {
            /* Our cool CSS */
            }

            <header>Pseudo-selectors</header>
            <p>
                Before diving into pseudo-selectors, a quick note on the difference between pseudo-elements 
                and pseudo-classes.
            </p>
            <h4>What is a pseudo-class?</h4>
            <p>
                A pseudo-class is a selector that selects elements that are in a specific state, e.g. 
                they are the first element of their type, or they are being hovered over by the mouse 
                pointer. They tend to act as if you had applied a class to some part of your document, 
                often helping you cut down on excess classes in your markup, and giving you more flexible, 
                maintainable code.
            </p>
            <p>
                They are prefixed with a single colon and are a different way to target elements that already 
                exist in HTML. E.g.
            </p>
            <pre>
            <code>
            /* This will target the first paragraph in an article 
            making it larger & bolder */
            article p:first-child {
                font-size: 120%;
                font-weight: bold;
            } 
            </code>
            </pre>
            <h4>What is a pseudo-element?</h4>
            <p>
                Pseudo-elements are prefixed with two colons and are used to target elements that don’t 
                normally exist in the markup. They act as if you had added a whole new HTML element into 
                the markup, rather than applying a class to existing elements. E.g.
            </p>
            <pre>
            <code>
            /*This will target the first line of a paragraph 
            and make it larger and bolder*/
            article p::first-line {
                font-size: 120%;
                font-weight: bold;
            } 
            </code>
            </pre>
        </section>
        <section id="Pseudo-classes" class="main-section">
            <header>Pseudo-classes</header>
            <p>
                Pseudo-classes offer us different ways to target elements in our HTML. They come in a couple of different 
                flavors. Some are based on their position or structure within the HTML. Others are based on the state 
                of a particular element, or how the user is currently interacting with it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Examples of Dynamic and User Action pseudo-classes that one will encounter are but not limited to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span>:focus</span> applies to an element that is currently selected by the user either through selecting 
                    it with their cursor or using their keyboard.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>:hover</span> will affect anything under the users mouse pointer. It can be used to give extra oomph to 
                    buttons and links to highlight that they’re interactable, or to trigger a drop down menu.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>:active</span> applies to elements that are currently being clicked, and is especially useful for 
                    giving your user feedback that their action had an effect.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Structural pseudo-classes are a powerful way to select elements based on their position 
                within the DOM. E.g.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span>:root</span> is generally the place where you will place your 'global' CSS rules that you want available 
                    everywhere - such as your custom properties and CSS variables, or rules such as 
                    box-sizing: border-box;
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>:first-child</span> and <span>:last-child</span> will match elements that are the first or last sibling.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>:empty</span> and <span>:only-child</span> will match elements that have no children at all, or just one.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>:nth-child</span> is a flexible pseudo-class with a few different uses and is dynamic.
                </li>
                <pre>
                <code>
                {/* Selects the 5th child of myList */}
                .myList:nth-child(5)

                { /* Selects every 3rd child of myList */}
                .myList:nth-child(3n)

                { /* Selects every 3rd child of myList, 
                beginning with the 3rd */}
                .myList:nth-child(3n + 3)

                {/* Selects every even child of myList */}
                .myList:nth-child(even)
                </code>
                </pre>

            <header>Pseudo-elements</header>
            <p>
                Pseudo-elements are more abstract in that they allow us to affect parts of our HTML that aren't 
                elements at all. E.g.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span>::marker</span> allows you to customize the styling of your <em>li</em> elements' bullets or numbers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>::first-letter</span> and <span>::first-line</span> allow you to give special styling to the first letter or 
                    line of some text.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>::before</span> and <span>::after</span> allow us to add extra elements onto the page with CSS, instead of 
                    HTML. Using it to decorate text in various ways is one common use case.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>::selection</span> allows you to change the highlighting when a user selects text on the page.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="Attribute_Selectors" class="main-section">
            <header>Attribute Selectors</header>
            <p>
                An attribute is simply anything in the opening tag of an HTML element - such as 
                <em>src='picture.jpg'</em>. Since we write our own values for attributes, we need a slightly more 
                flexible system to be able to target specific values.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some examples for basic usage:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span>[attribute]</span> - This general selector will select anything where the given attribute exists. 
                    Its value doesn't matter.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>selector[attribute]</span> - Optionally we can combine our attribute selectors with other types 
                    of selectors, such as class or element selectors.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>[attribute="value"]</span> - To get really specific, we can use = to match a specific attribute 
                    with a specific value.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                We may need to be more general in how we access these attributes. For example, perhaps we're only
                 interested in img elements where the src attribute's value ends in .jpg. For cases like 
                 this we have some attribute selectors that allow us to match a part of the attribute's value.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span>[attribute^="value"]</span> - <strong>^=</strong> Will match strings from the start.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>[attribute$="value"]</span> - <strong>$=</strong> Will match strings from the end.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>[attribute*="value"]</span> - <strong>*=</strong> The wildcard selector will match anywhere 
                    inside the string.
                </li>
